# Security Considerations

## API Keys and Tokens

This application uses the Twitter API which requires authentication. Please be aware of the following security considerations:

1. **Never commit API keys or tokens to public repositories**
   - The `.env` file containing your Twitter API bearer token should not be committed to version control
   - Use `.env.example` as a template without actual credentials

2. **Current Repository Status**
   - For demonstration purposes, a `.env` file with a bearer token has been committed
   - In a production environment, you should remove this file from Git:
     ```bash
     git rm --cached server/.env
     ```

3. **Token Rotation**
   - Regularly rotate your Twitter API tokens
   - If you suspect your token has been compromised, regenerate it immediately

## Data Privacy

1. **User Data**
   - This application processes public tweets but does not store them
   - Summaries and sentiment analysis are generated on-demand and not persisted

2. **Local Processing**
   - Ollama runs locally on your machine, so tweet content is not sent to external LLM services
   - This provides better privacy compared to cloud-based LLM solutions

## Recommendations

1. **Use Environment Variables**
   - Always use environment variables for sensitive information
   - Consider using a secrets management solution for production deployments

2. **Implement Rate Limiting**
   - Add rate limiting to prevent abuse of your Twitter API quota
   - Monitor your API usage in the Twitter Developer Portal

3. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   - Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
   - Run `npm audit` to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
